This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## DeepSeek AI Integration

The app now supports real LLM-backed debate behaviors:

- Solo mode opponent replies are generated from DeepSeek via `POST /api/ai/opponent-reply`.
- Debate finalization (winner + Master feedback) is generated via `POST /api/ai/finalize-debate`.
- Arena finalization is idempotent per room and fan-outs judged results to both participants.

Configure these environment variables (see `.env.example`):

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
DEEPSEEK_MODEL_OPPONENT=deepseek-chat
DEEPSEEK_MODEL_JUDGE=deepseek-reasoner
```

Swap DeepSeek models without changing code by editing:

- `DEEPSEEK_MODEL_OPPONENT`
- `DEEPSEEK_MODEL_JUDGE`
